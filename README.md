# CPAP
CPAP can be administered via a face mask, a nasal mask or through a CPAP hood.

1. CPAP must deliver inspired oxygen concentration in the range 35 – 80% to the patient,
selectable by the user. The selection of inspired oxygen should be continuous in the
range but could be in steps of 5%.
2. Should consume less than 5 L/m of oxygen, but could consume up to 10 L/m. Must not
consume more than 15 L/m of oxygen (this may require the use of a reservoir). However,
this requirement may change depending on the availability of oxygen at different stages of
the pandemic and in different treatment centres.
Gas and electricity
3. Incoming Gas Supply.
a. All gas connectors and hoses must comply with ISO ?!?, ISO
?!?.
b. Must connect to wall pipeline oxygen supply via ?!? compatible probes
(Schrader). If hose not permanently fixed to machine, then must connect with NIST (Non-
Interchangeable Screw Thread to ?!?).
Oxygen pipeline
pressure is approximately 3.7 – 4.5 bar.
c. Oxygen supply from wall outlets outside of ICU and theatres may be limited to
approximately 6-10 L/m averaged over the outlets within a ward.
d. Average oxygen consumption must be no more than 15 L/m. This may be allowed to
increase as greater certainty is gained over oxygen supply.
e. If CPAP connects to wall pipeline Medical Air (MA4, NOT SA7) it must be via ?!? compatible probes.
f.
An CPAP may include an oxygen concentrator(www.adapt.bg) as the source of oxygen. Note these
will typically be limited to 10 L/m 96% oxygen.
4. Could have the ability to entrain room air to reduce the oxygen requirement or conversely to
entrain oxygen when powered by medical air
5. Must maintain a nearly constant airway pressure of between 5–15 cmH 2 O, with the ability to
adjust the pressure. This will require the CPAP to deliver gas flows which equal or
exceed peak inspiratory flow rates in tachypnoeic patients.
6. Must either alarm or be provided with a suitable air entrainment system if the fresh gas
supply fails which prevents significant rebreathing
7. Should be able to work with existing specification close-fitting disposable face mask systems
(includes hoses), or hoods.
8. If the CPAP entrains room air this must pass through a suitable filter
9. Could have the ability to humidify the gas the patient breathes. This may not be required
with some breathing systems, such as with low flows of inspiratory gas and where breathing
is through the nose.
10. Must have as low a resistance to expiration as possible and should have a flow rate through
the PEEP valve which is largely independent of the PEEP level set.
11. Expiratory gas must be able to pass through an appropriate filter, which can be fitted using
standard connections to reduce contamination of the immediate environment.
12. Must have a pressure safety release valve to protect the patient from high pressures, having
a release pressure of no greater than 25 cmH 2 O. An over-pressure alarm should be
provided where possible and should not necessarily be confined to an electrically powered
CPAP.
13. Must be securely attached to the gas outlet (small gas powered systems), to a suitable pole
or rail system or to be provided with a suitable base.
14. Electrical Supply:
a. If mains powered RMVS must connect to 240V mains via standard BG plug.
b. Must have audible and visual alarm(s) for CPAP failure or switch off and if there
is over pressure at 25 cmH 2 O.
15. Infection control:
a. All parts coming into contact with the patient’s breath must be either disposable or
designed to be reusable.
b. All working components of the device must be contained within an impermeable
casing.
c. All external surfaces must be cleanable in the likely event that they get respiratory
secretions or blood splatter on them. Cleaning would be by healthcare workers
manually wiping using an approved surface wipe with disinfectant or cloths and
approved surface cleaning liquid.
d. There must be a separately sourced HMEF-bacterial-viral filter between the
machine and patient or filters fitted to the gas outlet of the machine and the exhaust
from the PEEP valve. These may impact on resistance within the system, which
may need to be accounted for. The pressure being delivered to the patient is the
specified pressure. Viral filters may have much higher resistance that may be
clinically relevant.
16. Software Safety
The Software in CPAP will almost certainly have the capability to cause serious
injury or death if risk control measures are not adequately implemented:
a. Software Development plan.
b. System and software requirements specifications.
c. Appropriate software architecture and software design documents.
d. A risk management plan and report.
e. Software verification and validation plans and reports.
f.QA!!!
A software release note.
17. Miscellaneous
1. Must be reliable. CPAP must be capable of continuous operation (100% duty
cycle) for 14 days.
2. Should be capable of operation continuously for more than 14 days.
3. The expected durability must be specified.
4. Could be floor standing.
5. Could be small and light enough to mount on patient bed with orientation independent
functioning.
6. Should not be excessively noisy.
7. Should be as robust as possible. For example, it may be dropped from bed height to
floor.
8. It must be intuitive to use for qualified medical personnel, but these may not be
specialists in CPAP use.
a.
Must not require more than 30 minutes training for a doctor with some experience
of CPAP use


Appendix A:
Clinical guidelines for infection control of CPAP.
This appendix is intended to guide developers on the likely clinical guidance users will be working to. It
is not actual guidance for users of such equipment.
1. CPAP equipment is kept in close proximity to patients and while the CPAP itself does
not come into direct or invasive contact with the patient, it will be physically connected to
equipment which does. Therefore, it is important all proposed CPAPs can be thoroughly
decontaminated by health care professionals in the health care setting.
2. The process for how this is carried out and guidance on design factors to be considered are
detailed below.
3. Where possible the process for cleaning CPAPs should be intuitive, however documentation
for the correct method of decontamination should be detailed in the instructions for use.
4. Preferably all components into direct contact with the patient’s breath will be disposable, where
this is not possible the process for sterilising reusable components should be detailed in the
instructions for use.
5. The external surfaces surface of the CPAP will need to be regularly decontaminated, once
every 24 hours minimum for multi day single patient use, and between each individual patient
use. This decontamination will be carried out by a nurse or other health care professional, using
either a single use disinfectant wipe or a liquid disinfectant applied with a disposable cloth.
6. All external surfaces of the CPAP will be cleaned, including screens, buttons and, control
switches. For this reason, it is important all CPAPs are designed in a way to prevent the
ingress of fluid through the casing. All screens should also be made of a material that that will
not cloud or smear after disinfection.
7. To prevent contamination of the patient gas pathway, and internal components, the CPAP
should be designed to use separately sourced HMEF-bacterial-viral filter between the machine
and patient. These filters will be place at the exhalation and inspiration ports of the CPAP
I.E. ports for breath in and out. The filters are bulky, measuring approximately 10CM each on
average and designs should be made with adequate spacing for both filters on dual port
CPAPs.
8. To prevent dust and other contaminates from entering the internal components of the CPAP,
all inlets and outlets to room air should also have a filter in place. Instructions on the method of
changing these filters, as well as the frequency that change is required, should be detailed in
the CPAP’s instructions for use.
9. If the option of using a hot water humidifier is also included in the design, methods of preventing
fluid ingress through inhalation and exhalation ports should be considered.
